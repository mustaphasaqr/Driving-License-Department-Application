The project encompasses several back-end applications and follows a well-defined process:

Requirements Analysis:

Carefully analyze the project requirements to design and build the database in SQL Server.
Establish relationships between tables and create the database schema.
Database Design:

Develop a detailed diagram outlining all table relationships, required columns, foreign keys, primary keys, and auto-number fields.
Three-Tier Architecture:

Construct a Windows application using a three-layer architecture, consisting of:
Data Access Layer (DAL): Handles database operations.
Business Layer: Implements business logic.
UI Layer: Manages user interactions.
SQL Server Communication:

Utilize advanced SQL instructions and techniques for efficient and readable communication with SQL Server using ADO.NET.
Data Structures:

Apply suitable data structures like lists and data tables across different layers, depending on the specific requirements.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:

Implement key OOP concepts such as polymorphism, abstraction, constructors, composition, by-reference, and encapsulation.
Design Patterns:

Apply the publisher-subscriber design pattern using delegation for efficient communication between components.
Business Logic and Algorithms:

Develop complex methods in the business layer, utilizing hard logic algorithms and implementing validation logic in the UI.
User Controls:

Create reusable and maintainable user controls to enhance the modularity and flexibility of the application.
UI Components Management:

Efficiently manage buttons and other controls within the Windows Forms application for a smooth user experience.
